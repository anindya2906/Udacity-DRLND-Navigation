##### **Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree**
# Project 1: Navigation

## **Introduction**
In this project we will train a Deep Q-Network Agent to navigate in a big square world and collect certain kind of items (yellow banana) while avioding another kind of item (blue banana).
On collecting a yellow banana the agent gets a reward of **+1** while collecting a blue banana will get the agent a reward of **-1**. The goal of the agent is to **collect as many yellow banana as possible while avoiding blue banana.**
The **state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction**. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **0 - move forward.**
- **1 - move backward.**
- **2 - turn left.**
- **3 - turn right.**

The task is episodic and in order to solve the environment **the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.**

## **Getting Started**
To get started with the project, first we need to download the environment.
You can download the environment from the links given below based on your platform of choice.
- **Linux: [Click Here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)**
- **Mac OSX: [Click Here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)**
- **Windows (32-bit): [Click Here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)**
- **Windows (64-bit): [Click Here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)**

**Once the file is downloaded, please extract the zip file into the root of the project.**

### **Setup the python environment**
Please create and activate a virtual environment with conda with the following command.
```sh
conda create -n drlnd python=3.6
conda activate drlnd
```
Once the environment is active run the follwoing command from the root of the project to install the required packages.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create an IPython kernel for the **drlnd** environment.
```sh
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

## **Instructions**
The training and Testing code is implemented in the [Navigation.ipynb](./Navigation.ipynb) Notebook.
To start the jupyter notebook run the below command from the root of this project folder.
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Once the jupyter notebook is started open your browser and go to http://localhost:8888/ and click on the Navigation.ipynb file to open the notebook.

Run all the cells in order to train a DQN-Agent from scratch and test it. Once training is completed successfully the model checkpoint will be stored as **model.pth** at the root of the project folder.

**In case you dont want to train the agent from scratch then please skip the code cell which calls the train method.**
